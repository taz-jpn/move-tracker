## Location Access (500 characters max)

```
Movement tracking feature requires background location access.

Users start a tracking session to record their commute, exercise, or travel. The app continuously monitors GPS position to calculate distance traveled, current speed, and detect transport mode (walking/cycling/vehicle).

Background access is essential because:
• Sessions can last hours during long commutes or exercise
• Users need tracking to continue when screen is off or app is minimized
• Accurate distance calculation requires uninterrupted GPS data

Users can stop tracking at any time.
